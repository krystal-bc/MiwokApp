# MiwokApp
The Miwok app is part of Udacity's 'Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps' course.

This app is meant to preserve the Miwok language by showing translations of different words and phrases. Incomplete for now.

Photos used in the app have not been included, I don't know if I can legally share them or not. They are provided in the tutorial.
